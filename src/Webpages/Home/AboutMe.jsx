                    Hey there! I’m Krishdev Sutar — part developer, part problem-solver, and full-time tech enthusiast. I like my code clean, my systems stable, and my weekends debug-free 😄.
                    </p>
                    <p className="main--section-description">
                    I kicked off my tech journey at Tata Consultancy Services, where I dove headfirst into the deep end of enterprise systems. From diagnosing day-to-day incidents on the BMO Investorline platform to programming secure log masking in Java, I’ve tackled some pretty gnarly bugs (and lived to tell the tale).
                    </p>
                    <p className="main--section-description">
                    I’m certified in AWS (Cloud Practitioner + Developer Associate), and I thrive on building backend solutions that are efficient, scalable, and secure. Whether it’s managing crisis situations during outages or fine-tuning backend processes, I’m your go-to guy for keeping things running smoothly — and securely.
                    </p>
                    <p className="main--section-description">
                    When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me grinding levels in video games or grinding reps at the gym — both are about patience, persistence, and that satisfying feeling of progress.
                    </p>
